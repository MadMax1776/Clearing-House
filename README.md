# Clearing-House
Buying and Selling Precious Metals


This project went surprisingly well for me once I switched my project theme on Thursday from building a CRUD app using python/django and hosting on heroku to just using angular for the CRUD and hosting it on AWS. The python stuff was going smoothly but it just wasn't moving fast enough for our classes timeframe. I started off by building my wordpress site and it is hosted here: https://maxwmeacham.zyrosite.com/
That went pretty except for the frustrating time I had with Hostinger which let me use a domain but then wouldn't let me edit it unless I transferred it to their editor site zyro. The problem is that I can't transfer the domain until 60 days after it's been published. So, I just built a site on there zyro editor without my custom domain. Once I had pretty much completed my wordpress site I then went on to build my python app but got nervous about the timeline when I still couldn't get anything to pull up in my CRUD database on Thursday morning. Therefore, I messaged Matt and asked if I could change my project new learn item to just hosting on AWS. I reasoned that I could build a CRUD app with Angular in roughly a day and could then focus entirely on getting it hosted on AWS on Saturday and Sunday. The link to the other gitrepo for the incomplete python stuff is here: https://github.com/MadMax1776/Gold-Clearing-House . Overall, I think I made the right decision and I stuck to the timeline almost exactly (I only managed to get the site up and running at around noon on Sunday). The app link is: http://18.188.128.226:3000/ . And here is the github:

If I had more time, I would like to add in some additional functionality such as using the metals api to bring in the live market price of certain metals such as gold, silver, copper etc, and also to add in authentication and ownership (where a user can buy and sell items on the app). Overall, I am quite pleased with how I got the app to turn out with the time I had after changing the project tech used.
